This repository presents a collection of data science and analytical projects developed over the course of one year as part of academic collaboration by Seyed Ramtin Hosseini and Akram Helal. The work focuses on applying R and RStudio with modern data science packages to analyze, visualize, and interpret diverse real-world datasets.

Key Tools & Libraries:

R & RStudio for data analysis and statistical computing

tidyverse for data wrangling and preprocessing

ggplot2 for advanced data visualization

gganimate and related libraries for animated visualizations

Geospatial packages (sf, leaflet, etc.) for spatial and tourism-related analysis

Datasets & Applications:

Spotify music data for trends and insights

Health-related data for statistical and geographical analysis

Tourism datasets with geographical data points and mapping

Additional datasets across multiple domains

Objectives:

To explore and apply modern data science techniques in R

To build reproducible workflows combining data wrangling, visualization, and geospatial analysis

To strengthen analytical skills through diverse, domain-specific projects
